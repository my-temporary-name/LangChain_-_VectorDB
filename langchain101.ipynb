    "## The Chains\n",
    "In LangChain, a chain is an end-to-end wrapper around multiple individual components, providing a way to accomplish a common use case by combining these components in a specific sequence. The most commonly used type of chain is the LLMChain, which consists of a PromptTemplate, a model (either an LLM or a ChatModel), and an optional output parser.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Takes (multiple) input variables.\n",
    "- Uses the PromptTemplate to format the input variables into a prompt.\n",
    "- Passes the formatted prompt to the model (LLM or ChatModel).\n",
    "- If an output parser is provided, it uses the OutputParser to parse the output of the LLM into a final format."
